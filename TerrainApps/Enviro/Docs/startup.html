<h3>Startup Dialog</h3>
<blockquote>
	This simple dialog is the first thing you see when you launch Enviro.&nbsp; There 
	are a few things you can do:<ul>
		<li>Choose which image to use to texture-map the earth in Earth View.</li>
		<li>Choose which terrain to view in Terrain View.</li>
		<li>Edit the <a href="terrain_creation.html">terrain properties</a> of 
		the selected terrain.</li>
		<li>Open the Terrain Manager dialog (below).</li>
		<li>Set a few Global Options, including:<ul>
			<li>Full Screen<ul>
				<li>Enviro will attempt to open a full-screen window, with only 
				the toolbar added to the immersive 3D experience.&nbsp; You can also 
				toggle this at any time after the main window opens, with the 
				&quot;View - Fullscreen&quot; menu, or Ctrl-F.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Set Size Exaggeration for Plants and Fences<ul>
				<li>This will affect any terrain you open in Terrain View, and 
				can be useful for working with large areas where these culture 
				features are often small and hard to see.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Check your OpenGL Info<ul>
				<li>This is a good thing to check the first time you run Enviro 
				on a new machine, to troubleshoot issues with your 3D card and 
				driver, and to learn the largest texture your system can handle.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Terrain Manager Dialog</h3>
<blockquote>
	From this dialog, you can:<ul>
		<li>Add and remove paths from your <a href="data_path.html">Data Path</a></li>
		<li>Create and delete terrains.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Another easy way to create a new terrain is to copy an existing one.&nbsp; You 
	can then Edit Parameters of the new terrain, including giving it a new name.</p>
