<h2><i>Abstract Layers</i></h2>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Abstract Layers</i> in the VTP software means any kind of raw geometry 
data (points, lines, polylines, polygons) which do not represent a real-world 
object.&nbsp; For example, waypoints, political boundaries, property areas, GPS 
tracks.&nbsp; These are the kind of features traditionally handled by <b>GIS</b> 
software.&nbsp; Abstract Layers can be loaded and saved to <b>SHP</b> files 
(ESRI Shapefile format, often with an accompanying <b>DBF</b> file).&nbsp; You 
can have any number of abstract layers on each terrain.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Adding Abstract Layers to your Terrain</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>To include structures from a SHP file, edit the
<a href="terrain_creation.html">properties for your terrain</a>.&nbsp; Under the
<b>Abstract Layers</b> tab, double-click to choose from a list of all the SHP 
files that are located in <b>PointData</b> folders on your data path.&nbsp; <i>
(The directory is called PointData because VTP used to only support points, but 
you can in fact put any kind of SHP dataset there.)</i></p>

<p>Each layer can be displayed with its own Style, which you set with the <a href="style_dialog.html">Style Dialog</a>.</p>

<p>You can also create a new, empty Abstract Layer at runtime, containing 
labeled point features, by pressing <b>Create</b> in the Layer Dialog.&nbsp; The 
Style Dialog will appear.&nbsp; You can also do this by using the <b>Create 
Points</b> mode (menu Tools: Points, or the pushpin on the toolbar) which will 
create an Abstract Point Layer for you if none exists.</p>

</blockquote>
    <h3>The Layer Dialog in Terrain View</h3>
    <blockquote>
    <h3><img alt="Layer Dialog" src="../images/layer_dlg3.png" width="549" height="283" /></h3>
    <p>Abstract layers are shown in the <b>Layers Dialog</b> above.&nbsp; You 
	can do these operations on an abstract layer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Zoom To:</b> Move the camera so that the selected layer in view.</li>
        <li><b>Save:</b> Write the active layer to the SHP file which it was 
		loaded from.</li>
        <li><b>Save As: </b>Write the active layer to a SHP file with another 
		name.</li>
        <li><b>Create:</b> Create a new, empty point feature layer.</li>
        <li><b>Remove: </b>Remove a selected layer.</li>
        <li><b>Visible:</b> Toggle whether the selected layer is visible.</li>
      </ul>
