<h2><i>Abstract Layers</i></h2>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>Abstract Layers</i> in the VTP software means any kind of raw geometry 
	data (points, lines, polylines, polygons) which do not represent a real-world 
	object.&nbsp; For example, waypoints, political boundaries, property areas, 
	GPS tracks.&nbsp; These are the kind of features traditionally handled by <b>
	GIS</b> software.&nbsp; Abstract Layers can be loaded and saved to <b>SHP</b> 
	files (ESRI Shapefile format, often with an accompanying <b>DBF</b> file).&nbsp; 
	You can have any number of abstract layers on each terrain.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Adding Abstract Layers to your Terrain</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>To include structures from a SHP file, you can:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Edit the <a href="terrain_creation.html">properties for your terrain</a>.&nbsp; Under 
	the <b>Abstract Layers</b> tab, double-click to choose from a list of all the 
	SHP files that are located in <b>PointData</b> folders on your data path.&nbsp;
		<i>(The directory is called PointData because VTP used to only support points, 
	but you can in fact put any kind of SHP dataset there.)</i></li>
		<li>Or, use the <strong>Load Layer</strong> button in the Layer Dialog, 
		at runtime.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Each layer can be displayed with its own Style, which you set with the
	<a href="style_dialog.html">Style Dialog</a>.</p>
	<p>You can also create a new, empty Abstract Layer at runtime, containing labeled 
	point features, by pressing <b>Create</b> in the Layer Dialog.&nbsp; The Style 
	Dialog will appear.&nbsp; You can also do this by using the <b>Create Points</b> 
	mode (menu Tools: Points, or the pushpin on the toolbar) which will create an 
	Abstract Point Layer for you if none exists.</p>
