</head>

<body>

<h1><i>Enviro</i></h1>
<h2>Terrain View</h2>
<p>From the Startup Dialog, to launch with Terrain:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use the drop-down control to choose from the known terrains.</li>
	<li>Use &quot;Edit Properties&quot; to view or edit the properties of the currently 
	chosen terrain (the <b><a href="terrain_creation.html">Terrain Parameters</a></b> 
	dialog)</li>
</ul>
<p>Press &quot;OK&quot;.&nbsp; The terrain will now load, which may take up to a 
minute.&nbsp; Messages in the status bar will inform you of the loading progress.</p>
<h4>How to Navigate:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Here&#39;s a handy guide for <a href="navigation.html">using the mouse to 
	navigate</a> in Terrain View.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Menu Commands for Terrain View</h3>
<h4>File Menu</h4>
<ul>
	<li><b>Layers</b> - Shows the Layers dialog.</li>
	<li><strong>Create Layer</strong> - open the Create New Layer dialog box</li>
	<li><strong>Load Layer</strong> - browse for a file (VTST or GIS format) to 
	open as a new layer.</li>
	<li><strong>Save Terrain State</strong> - When the terrain&#39;s parameters 
	have been loaded from a .xml file, this command saves the current state of the 
	terrain back to that .xml file.&nbsp; The state includes the ephemeris, time 
	of day, names of loaded layers, and scenarios.</li>
	<li><strong>Save Terrain State As... - </strong>Same as Save Terrain State, 
	but saves to a new file.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Scene Menu</h4>
<ul>

	structure of the scene including its engines.</li>
	<li><strong>Go to Terrain...</strong> - Choose another terrain to switch to.</li>
	<li><strong>Go to Space</strong> - Switch to <a href="earth_view.html">Earth

	<li><strong>Fullscreen</strong> - Toggle for fullscreen rendering.</li>
	<li><strong>Top-Down Camera</strong> - Toggle between the normal camera and

	In CAD, this is often called &#39;Plan View&#39;.</li>
	<li><strong>Framerate Chart</strong> - Toggle showing the current framerate 
	as a little yellow line chart in the lower-left corner of the view.</li>
	<li><strong>Elevation Legend</strong> - For terrain with texture derived from 
	elevation, show the mapping from elevation values to colors.</li>
	<li><strong>Compass</strong> - Toggle a small directional compass in the upper-right 
	corner of the view.&nbsp; This shows which way the camera is facing; it is a &#39;heading&#39; 
	compass.</li>
	<li><strong>Overview</strong> - Toggle a floating overview map in the lower-left 
	corner of the view.&nbsp; Only works for simple terrain (not tilesets) for which 
	the entire terrain texture is always in memory.</li>
	<li><strong>Camera - View Settings</strong> - Open the Camera dialog.</li>
	<li><strong>Store/Recall Locations</strong> - Open the Locations dialog, which 
	also lets you record or load animation paths and play them.</li>

	<li><strong>Save Numbered Snapshot</strong> - Same as Save Window Snapshot, 
	but automatically and quietly saves a snapshot to the same filename as before, 
	with an increasing number attached (_000, _001, _002, etc.)</li>
	<li><strong>High-resolution Snapshot</strong> - Save the window snapshot at 
	a resolution higher than your on-screen window.&nbsp; While this can be larger 
	than your screen, it will only work up to a certain size, determined by your 
	3D graphics hardware.</li>
	<li><strong>Status Bar</strong> - Toggle the window&#39;s status bar.</li>
	<li><strong>Scenarios</strong> - Open the Scenarios dialog.</li>
	<li><strong>Toolbars</strong> - Toggle some toolbar buttons by function.&nbsp;

</ul>
<h4>Navigate Menu</h4>
<ul>
	<li><b>Fly Slower</b> - Decrease flight speed</li>
	<li><b>Fly Faster</b> - Increase flight speed</li>
	<li><b>Maintain height above ground</b> (toggle) - Keeps the camera at a fixed 
	height above the terrain.</li>
	<li><b>Navigation Style</b> - Choose from several styles of navigation to find 
	one you like.&nbsp; There is also a keyboard shortcut &#39;D&#39; to toggle 
	the Grab-Pivot navigation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Terrain Menu</h4>
<ul>
	<li><b>LOD Terrain Surface </b>(toggle) - Show the terrain surface.</li>
	<li><b>Cull every frame</b> (toggle) - Continuously calculates the level of 
	detail needed as the camera moves.&nbsp; You can turn this off to see how the 
	CLOD algorithm is working.</li>
	<li><b>Cull once</b> - When Cull Every Frame is turned off, this tells the CLOD 
	to calculate (cull).</li>
	<li><b>Show Sky</b> (toggle) - The sky (Skydome) is a hemisphere which surround 
	the camera, showing either a static texture, or correct lighting for the time 
	of day (sun, moon, stars, sunrise, sunset).</li>
	<li><b>Show Horizon</b> (toggle) - The horizon is the flat geometry between 
	the edge of the terrain and the far clipping plane.</li>
	<li><b>Show Ocean</b> (toggle) - The ocean plane is an additional flat geometry 
	which intersects the entire terrain, with a watery translucent texture.</li>
	<li><b>Show Plants</b> (toggle) - You can turn all plants (the Vegetation Layer) 
	on and off.</li>
	<li><b>Show Structures</b> (toggle).</li>
	<li><b>Show Roads</b> (toggle).</li>
	<li><b>Show Fog</b> (toggle).<br />
	</li>
	<li><b>Increase Detail</b> - Increases the detail (triangles or vertices used) 
	of the CLOD terrain surface by 1000.&nbsp; If your terrain is over-simplified, 
	you should increase detail until it looks good.</li>
	<li><b>Decrease Detail</b> - Decreases the detail (triangles or vertices used) 
	of the CLOD terrain surface by 1000.</li>
	<li><b>Level of Detail Info</b> - Shows the Terrain LOD Info dialog with technical 
	information about the CLOD algorithm and (if you are using Tilesets) the texture 
	paging.</li>
	<li><b>Toggle Artificial Foundations</b> - For the current structure layer, 
	each building which lies on a slope has a cement &quot;foundation&quot; level 
	added to elevate it such that no point of the base footprint lies beneath ground 
	level.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;<b>Recalculate Shading</b> - If your terrain has shading that was 
	computed at the time the terrain was constructed, then that shading is recalculated.&nbsp; 
	The current time of day is used.&nbsp; This is useful for seeing what a terrain 
	looks like at different times of day.</li>
	<li><b>Change Texture</b> - Opens the Change Texture dialog to let you change 
	the texture on the terrain.</li>
	<li><b>Distribute Vehicles</b> - Puts a number of test vehicles around your 
	road network, where they will will traverse randomly.&nbsp; This is not a real 
	simulation, just a simple test.</li>
</ul>
