<h2><i>Image Layers</i></h2>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Image Layers</i> in the VTP software.&nbsp; You can add any number of 
image layers on each terrain, but since they are limited by the number of <b>
multi-texture units</b> your graphics card has, the number displayed may be 
limited to 3.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Adding Image Layers to your Terrain</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>To add an Image layer, edit the
<a href="terrain_creation.html">properties for your terrain</a>.&nbsp; Under the
<b>Texture</b> tab, under <b>Image Layers</b>, double-click to choose from a 
list of all the image files that are located in any <b>GeoSpecific</b> folder on 
your data path.</p>

<p>The image must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Georeferenced.</b>&nbsp; Specifically, it must have extents defined.&nbsp; An 
	easy way to ensure this is to use GeoTIFF format, but you can also use other 
	TIF or JPEG files as long as they have a World File which defines their 
	extents.</li>
  <li><b>The same CRS (projection) as the terrain.</b>&nbsp; Image layers will not be 
	dynamically reprojected.</li>
  <li>Within the<b> </b><b>size limits</b> of your graphics card.&nbsp; Modern 
  3D cards will support up to 8192* 8192.&nbsp; You 
	can also use smaller images, e.g. 1024x1024, and rectangular images, e.g. 
	2048x512.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have an older card without OpenGL 2.0, the the image should also be:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Power of 2 in each dimension.</b>&nbsp; For example, 256x512 is supported, 
	300*711 is not.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Image layers are shown in the <b>Layers Dialog</b>.&nbsp; You can do 
	these operations on an image layer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Remove: </b>Remove the selected layer.</li>
        <li><b>Visible:</b> Toggle whether the selected layer is visible.</li>
      </ul>
</blockquote>
