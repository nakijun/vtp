	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="c1" nowrap="" valign="top">Recompute shadows<br />
&nbsp;every frame</td>
		<td class="c1">If true, then the shadows are truly dynamic.&nbsp; If false,

		There is a performance cost to this option, depending greatly on your CPU

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="c1" nowrap="" valign="top">Limit shadow area</td>
		<td class="c1">The shadow resolution must be stretched over the area of

		<td class="c1" nowrap="" valign="top">Ocean Plane Level</td>
		<td class="c1">The is the elevation, in meters, at which the ocean plane

		<td class="c1">Loads an elevation TIN as a water surface, which usually

		displaced.&nbsp; This can be useful combined with &quot;Ocean Plane&quot;, 
		since many Elevation data files represent the ocean as &quot;sea level&quot;, 
		this option will restore some depth to the ocean, so that it will not intersect 
		the Ocean Plane.<br />
		Another useful effect of this option is that it produces a &quot;cliff&quot; 
		at the shoreline, which can help the CLOD algorithm to maintain the shoreline.</td>
	</tr>
