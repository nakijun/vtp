<h2>Enviro - Terrain Creation Parameters</h2>
<h3>Elevation</h3>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
	<tr>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th valign="top" class="c2" rowspan="3" nowrap>Terrain LOD</th>
		<td valign="top" class="c2" nowrap>Method</td>
		<td class="c2">Choose from several implementations of published Continuous 
		LOD algorithms.&nbsp; Unless you are an expert user, it is recommended 
		to use only <em><strong>Roettger</strong></em>.&nbsp; The others are 
		historical or of interest to algorithm specialists.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c2" nowrap>Triangle Count</td>
		<td class="c2">Algorithms will adaptively adjust detail to meet this 
		indicated triangle count.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c2" nowrap>Use strips/fans</td>
		<td class="c2">Allows the LOD algorithm to use triangle strips and 
		fans while rendering.&nbsp; With some algorithms, this may increase rendering 
		speed significantly, and also may also introduce some limitations.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th valign="top" class="c1" nowrap>Elevation TIN</th>
		<td valign="top" class="c1" nowrap>TIN Filename</td>
		<td class="c1">The TIN file to use for elevation, instead of an elevation

		this indicated vertex count.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c2" nowrap>RAM cache size</td>
		<td class="c2">When tiles are loaded from disk, they are stored in 
		a cache in RAM.&nbsp; As the camera moves around, tiles which are not needed 
		remain in this cache, which avoids loading them from disk again while the 
		program is running.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th valign="top" class="c1" nowrap>&nbsp;</th>
		<td valign="top" class="c1" nowrap>Vertical Exaggeration</td>

		<td class="c1">You provide a single large square image file, and 
		Enviro will break it up for you, at runtime, into a set of 16 tiles (4x4).&nbsp; 
		The filename is made up of three parts: the prefix (e.g. &quot;hawaii_&quot;), the 
		image size (e.g. &quot;4093&quot;) and the format (either BMP or JPG). The dialog 
		lets you specify the prefix and tile size, and it computes and appends the 
		image size.</td>

		depending on your graphics hardware.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c1" nowrap>Request 16-bit</td>
		<td class="c1">Normally, textures are processed as 24-bit images.&nbsp; 
		This options tells the 3d hardware that it is OK to use only 16-bits, which 
		can save significant texture RAM.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c1" nowrap>Precompute lighting</td>
		<td class="c1">At runtime, Enviro will make the terrain texture darker/lighter 
		to simulate the sun&#39;s light.&nbsp; This is not necessary if you are using 
		a Geospecific texture which already contains shadows.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c1" nowrap>Lighting factor</td>
		<td class="c1">Use this scaling factor to make the precomputed lighting 
		more pronounced or more subtle.&nbsp; 1.0 is the standard value.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c1" nowrap>Cast Shadows</td>
		<td class="c1">If true, then the terrain shading will use a ray-casting 
		approach, so that the terrain casts shadows onto itself.&nbsp; If false, 
		then simpler (dot-product) shading is used.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c1" nowrap>Retain loaded<br />
&nbsp;texture in memory</td>
		<td class="c1">If you are loading a texture from disk and shading it, 
		this option will keep an unshaded copy of the texture in memory, so that 
		you can change the shading at runtime without waiting for the texture to 
		load again.&nbsp; If this is not what you are doing, leave the option 
		off.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c1" nowrap>Detail texture</td>
		<td class="c1"><i>Currently only works with the McNally CLOD option.<br />
		</i>Will attempt to put a second, high-frequency detail texture over the 
		whole terrain, faded by distance so that it is only visible close to the 
		viewer.&nbsp; Currently this can only be a single texture, although eventually 
		it should be multiple textures based on type of ground cover (dirt, rock, 
		grass, etc.)</td>

		<td valign="top" class="c2" nowrap>Terrain-specific<br />
&nbsp;Content</td>
		<td class="c2">A content file (.vtco) which contains additional content

		Australia, you might have a set of Australian content items specific here, 
		&quot;Australia.vtco&quot;.</td>

		terrain (and other structures).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c1" nowrap>Resolution</td>
		<td class="c1">The resolution of the shadow map texture.&nbsp; Shadows

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c1" nowrap>Darkness</td>
		<td class="c1">A value from 0 to 1 for shadow darkness.&nbsp; Older 3D 
		cards do not support variable darkness, so they will ignore this value, 
		and shadows will always be black.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c1" nowrap>All structures cast<br />
&nbsp;shadows by default</td>
		<td class="c1">If true, then every structure is automatically set to

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c1" nowrap>Recompute shadows<br />
&nbsp;every frame</td>
		<td class="c1">If true, then the shadows are truly dynamic.&nbsp; If 
		false, shadows are only recomputed periodically, such as when the sun 
		moves.&nbsp; There is a performance cost to this option, depending 
		greatly on your CPU and GPU.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c1" nowrap>Limit shadow area</td>
		<td class="c1">The shadow resolution must be stretched over the area of

		where the camera is looking.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c1" nowrap><strong>Paging</strong></td>
		<td class="c1">Instead of all structures being created when the terrain 
		loads, structures are loaded and unloaded dynamically (&quot;paging&quot;) as the 
		camera moves around.&nbsp; This allows you to quickly load terrains with 
		huge numbers of buildings, and fly around without using too much memory</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c1" nowrap>Maximum structures</td>
		<td class="c1">When the number of loaded structures exceeds this number,

		<td class="c1" valign="top" nowrap>Ocean Plane Level</td>
		<td class="c1">The is the elevation, in meters, at which the ocean 
		plane will appear.&nbsp; Normally you would set this to either 0 (exact

		problems between the ocean place and some terrains.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="c1" valign="top" nowrap>Depress Ocean</td>
		<td class="c1">Set this option to change your elevation such that 
		all points at &quot;sea level&quot; (elevation = 0 meters exactly) are artificially 
		displaced.&nbsp; This can be useful combined with &quot;Ocean Plane&quot;, since many 
		Elevation data files represent the ocean as &quot;sea level&quot;, this option will 
		restore some &quot;depth&quot; to the ocean, so that it will not intersect the Ocean 
		Plane.<br />
		Another useful effect of this option is that it produces a &quot;cliff&quot; at the 
		shoreline, which can help the CLOD algorithm to maintain the shoreline.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="c1" valign="top" nowrap>Depress Ocean Level</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c2" nowrap>Fog</td>
		<td class="c2">Fog causes an evenly distributed haze to appear, gradually

		from the camera.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="c2">Scene Background<br />
&nbsp;Color</td>

		<td valign="top" class="c2" nowrap>Image file</td>
		<td class="c2">You can specify an image file which will be drawn

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="c2" nowrap>Placement</td>
