<h1><i>Enviro</i></h1>
<h2>Startup Dialog</h2>
<blockquote>
	This simple dialog is the first thing you see when you launch Enviro.&nbsp; 
	There are a few things you can do:<ul>
		<li>Choose which image to use to texture-map the earth in Earth View.</li>
		<li>Choose which terrain to view in Terrain View.</li>
		<li>Edit the <a href="terrain_creation.html">terrain properties</a> of the 
		selected terrain.</li>
		<li>Open the Terrain Manager dialog (below).</li>
		<li>Open the Global Options dialog (below).</li>
		<li>Check your OpenGL Info<ul>
			<li>This is a good thing to check the first time you run Enviro on a 
			new machine, to troubleshoot issues with your 3D card and driver, and 
			to learn the largest texture your system can handle.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Terrain Manager Dialog</h3>
<blockquote>
	From this dialog, you can:<ul>
		<li>Add and remove paths from your <a href="data_path.html">Data Path</a></li>
		<li>Create and delete terrains.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Another easy way to create a new terrain is to copy an existing one.&nbsp; 
	You can then Edit Parameters of the new terrain, including giving it a new name.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Global Options Dialog</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>These options affect the entire Enviro application, including both the Earth 
	View and Terrain View.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Display<ul>
		<li>Full screen<ul>
			<li>Enviro will attempt to open a full-screen window, with only the 
			toolbar added to the immersive 3D experience.&nbsp; You can also toggle 
			this at any time after the main window opens, with the &quot;View - 
			Fullscreen&quot; menu, or Ctrl-F.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Stereo<ul>
			<li>There are two kinds of stereoscopic rendering available: Anaglyphic 
			(used with cheap red-blue glasses) and Quad Buffer (used with more expensive 
			shutter glasses or polarized stereo display systems).&nbsp; If you enable 
			stereo, then at runtime in the <strong>Camera Dialog</strong>, you can 
			control the<strong> Eye Separation</strong> and <strong>Fusion Distance</strong>.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Window size<ul>
		<li>If you are not starting in Full Screen, then you can set the exact size 
		and location of Enviro&#39;s main window.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Texture compression<ul>
		<li>If set, then all textures which are applied to model created by the 
		VTP software (instead of loaded from external 3D models) will default to 
		compressed (S3TC compression). </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Disable model mipmaps<ul>
		<li>If set, then all models which are loaded from external 3D files will 
		have mipmapping disabled on their textures.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Selection<ul>
		<li>Use direct picking<ul>
			<li>When selecting objects in Terrain View, the object directly under 
			the pixel of the mouse cursor will be selected.&nbsp; This mode is experimental, 
			and not all operations are supported.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Maximum radius for selecting models<ul>
			<li>If you have some very large 3D models in your scene, you may want 
			to avoid selecting them.&nbsp; For example, if you have two models: 
			a long road 300m long, and a car 4m long.&nbsp; You may want to avoid 
			selecting the road.&nbsp; You can set the maximum radius to 5m, and 
			only the car will be selectable. </li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Set Size Exaggeration for Plants and Fences<ul>
		<li>This will affect any terrain you open in Terrain View, and can be useful 
		for working with large areas where these culture features are often small 
		and hard to see.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Show only species with available appearances<ul>
		<li>If you have a large plant library (species.xml), but not all plants 
		are available, select this option to hide all the unavailable species.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Global content file<ul>
		<li>Content items (models with metadata and LOD) in the global content file 
		are available to all terrains.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Show progress dialog during terrain creation<ul>
		<li>If set, you will see a progress dialog.&nbsp; This is useful for letting 
		users know that something is happening when loading large terrain.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fly in gradually from earth view<ul>
		<li>If set, when you click on a terrain in Earth View, you will be taken 
		down to the terrain in a series of stages:<ol>
			<li>The camera will orbit the earth until it is directly over the terrain, 
			and zoom in close</li>
			<li>Enviro switches to Terrain View, with the camera still high above 
			the terrain</li>
			<li>The camera flies down directly to the terrain&#39;s current view 
			locaiton</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
