<h3>Working with Culture Objects</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Culture</span></i> 
    is visual-simulation terminology for all the things that appear on the terrain -
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">including 
    buildings, roads, and vegetation.&nbsp; Enviro provides a number of ways of 
    loading culture objects, interacting with them, and in some cases creating, 
    editing and saving them.</span></p>
    <h4>Roads</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Roads are loaded at the point a terrain is loaded.&nbsp; You can tell 
      Enviro which file contains your Road data in the <b><a href="terrain_creation.html">Terrain  Parameters</b></a> 
      dialog.</p>
      <p>You can view, but cannot (yet) interact with Road data.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>Vegetation</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Vegetation (plants) are loaded at the point a terrain is loaded.&nbsp; 
      You can tell Enviro which file contains your Vegetation data in the <a href="terrain_creation.html"> <b>Terrain  Parameters</b></a> 
      dialog.</p>
      <p><i>Creating </i>- You can create plants using the Plants Dialog.&nbsp; 
      Menu command is &quot;Tools: Plants&quot;, or the toolbar button that looks like a 
      tree.&nbsp; Use the dialog to select what kind of plant you want, then 
      click on the terrain to create the plant.</p>
      <p><i>Editing </i>- To edit existing plants, use the Select tool (Menu 
      &quot;Tools: Select&quot;).&nbsp; Click to select the plant with the 3D cursor.&nbsp; 
      Right-click and select &quot;Properties&quot;.&nbsp; This will open the Plants 
      Dialog to edit the properties of the selected plant.</p>
      <p><i>Moving</i> - Select the plant with the Select Tool, then drag to 
      move it on the terrain.</p>
      <p><i>Deleting </i>- Select the plant with the Select Tool, then 
      right-click and select &quot;Delete.&quot;</p>
      <p><i>Saving </i>- Menu command is &quot;Terrain: Save Vegetation As...&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>Structures</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Structures (buildings, fences and  3D model instances) that are in the 
      terrain definition are loaded 
      at the point the terrain is loaded.&nbsp; You can tell Enviro which file(s) 
      contain your Structure data in the <a href="terrain_creation.html"> <b>Terrain  Parameters</b></a> 
      dialog.&nbsp; At runtime in Terrain View, you can use the Layers Dialog 
      (see <b><a href="structures.html">Structure Layers</a></b>) to display your structure 
      layers, and change the active layer.&nbsp; Editing in the 3D View such as 
      creating structures will affect the active structure layer.</p>
      <p><i>Creating </i>- Instance and Linear Structures (fences) can be 
      created dynamically.&nbsp; Use the &quot;Tools: Instances&quot; and &quot;Tools: 
      Fences&quot; 
      modes respectively to open the properties dialog, then click on the 
      terrain to create the structure.</p>
      <p><i>Editing </i>- Buildings and fences can be edited.&nbsp; Use the Select tool 
      (Menu &quot;Tools: Select&quot;).&nbsp; Click to select the structure with the 3D 
      cursor.&nbsp; Right-click and select &quot;Properties&quot;.&nbsp; This will open 
      the Building Dialog or Linear Structure Dialog to edit the properties of 
      what you have selected.</p>
      <p><i>Moving and Rotating </i>- Structures can be moved.&nbsp; 
      Select the structure with the Select Tool, then drag to move it on the 
      terrain.&nbsp; Linear Structures can have each of their points moved.&nbsp; Instances can also be rotated: hold down the Shift key when 
      moving the object, and it will rotate.</p>
      <p><i>Deleting </i>- Structures can be deleted.&nbsp; Select 
      the structure with the Select Tool, then right-click for the popup menu and select &quot;Delete.&quot;</p>
      <p><i>Saving </i>- Use the Layers Dialog.&nbsp; Highlight the structure layer you want to save, then 
      use the &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Save As&quot; button.</p>
