<h2><i>Enviro</i></h2>
<h3>Working with Culture Objects</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p><i><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Culture</span></i> 
	is visual-simulation terminology for all the things that appear on the terrain 
	- <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">including buildings, 
	roads, and vegetation.&nbsp; Enviro provides a number of ways of loading culture 
	objects, interacting with them, and in some cases creating, editing and saving 
	them.</span></p>
	<h4>Roads</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Roads are loaded at the point a terrain is loaded.&nbsp; You can tell 
		Enviro which file contains your Road data in the <b>
		<a href="terrain_creation.html">Terrain Parameters</a></b><a href="terrain_creation.html"></a> 
		dialog. You can view, but cannot (yet) interact with Road data.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h4>Vegetation</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Vegetation (plants) are loaded at the point a terrain is loaded, or 
		at runtime.&nbsp; 
		You can tell Enviro which file contains your Vegetation data in the
		<a href="terrain_creation.html"><b>Terrain Parameters</b></a> dialog.</p>
		<p><i><strong>Creating</strong> </i>- You can create plants using the Plants Dialog.&nbsp; 
		Menu command is &quot;Tools: Plants&quot;, or the toolbar button that looks like a 
		tree.&nbsp; Use the dialog to select what kind of plant you want, then click 
		on the terrain to create the plant.</p>
		<p><i><strong>Editing</strong> </i>- To edit existing plants, use the Select tool (Menu &quot;Tools: 
		Select&quot;).&nbsp; Click to select the plant with the 3D cursor.&nbsp; Right-click 
		and select &quot;Properties&quot;.&nbsp; This will open the Plants Dialog to edit 
		the properties of the selected plant.</p>
		<p><i><strong>Moving</strong></i> - Select the plant with the Select Tool, then drag to move 
		it on the terrain.</p>
		<p><i><strong>Deleting</strong> </i>- Select the plant with the Select Tool, then right-click 
		and select &quot;Delete.&quot;</p>
		<p><i><strong>Saving</strong> </i>- Menu command is &quot;Terrain: Save Vegetation As...&quot;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h4>Structures</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Structures (buildings, linears structures and 3D model instances) that are in the 
		terrain definition are loaded at the point the terrain is loaded.&nbsp; 
		You can tell Enviro which file(s) contain your Structure data in the
		<a href="terrain_creation.html"><b>Terrain Parameters</b></a> dialog.&nbsp; 
		At runtime in Terrain View, you can use the <strong>
		<a href="layers.html">Layers Dialog</a></strong> to display your structure 
		layers, and change the active layer.&nbsp; Editing in the 3D View such as 
		creating structures will affect the active structure layer.</p>
		<p><i><strong>Creating</strong> </i>- Instance and Linear Structures (fences) can be created 
		dynamically.&nbsp; Use the &quot;Tools: Instances&quot; and &quot;Tools: Fences&quot; modes 
		respectively to open the properties dialog, then click on the terrain to 
		create the structure.</p>
		<p><i><strong>Editing</strong> </i>- Buildings and fences can be edited.&nbsp; Use the Select 
		tool (Menu &quot;Tools: Select&quot;).&nbsp; Click to select the structure with the 
		3D cursor.&nbsp; Right-click and select &quot;Properties&quot;.&nbsp; This will open 
		the Building Dialog or Linear Structure Dialog to edit the properties of 
		what you have selected.</p>
		<p><i><strong>Moving and Rotating</strong> </i>- Structures can be moved.&nbsp; Select the 
		structure with the Select Tool, then drag to move it on the terrain.&nbsp; 
		Linear Structures can have each of their points moved.&nbsp; Instances can 
		also be rotated: hold down the Shift key when moving the object, and it 
		will rotate.</p>
		<p><i><strong>Deleting</strong> </i>- Structures can be deleted.&nbsp; Select the structure 
		with the Select Tool, then right-click for the popup menu and select &quot;Delete.&quot;</p>
		<p><i><strong>Saving</strong> </i>- Use the Layers Dialog.&nbsp; Highlight the structure 
		layer you want to save, then use the &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Save As&quot; buttons.</p>
