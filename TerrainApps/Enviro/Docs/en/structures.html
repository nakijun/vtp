<h2><i>Structure Layers</i></h2>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>Structures</i> in the VTP software means <b>buildings</b>, <b>linear</b> 
	structure such as walls and fences, and <b>instances</b> of external 3D model 
	files.&nbsp; They are contained in Structure Layers, which can be loaded and 
	saved to VTST files.&nbsp; You can have any number of structure layers on each 
	terrain.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Adding Structure Layers to your Terrain</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>To include structures from a VTST file, edit the
	<a href="terrain_creation.html">properties for your terrain</a>.&nbsp; Under 
	the <b>Culture</b> tab, double-click <b>Structure Files</b> to choose from a 
	list of all the VTST files that are located in <b>BuildingData</b> folders on 
	your data path.</p>
	<p>You can also create a new, empty Structure Layer at runtime, by pressing
	<b>Create</b> in the Layer Dialog.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Layer Dialog in Terrain View</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	<img alt="Layer Dialog" height="358" src="../images/layer_dlg2.jpg" width="540" /></p>
	<p>Structure layers are shown in the <b>Layers Dialog</b> above.&nbsp; The active 
	structure layer is shown in <b>bold</b>.&nbsp; The operations shown will affect 
	the active layer.&nbsp; You can make any layer active by clicking on it or any 
	of its items.&nbsp; You can do these operations on a structure layer:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Zoom To:</b> Move the camera so that the selected item in view.</li>
		<li><b>Save:</b> Write the active layer to the VTST file which it was loaded 
		from.</li>
		<li><b>Save As: </b>Write the active layer to a VTST file with another name.</li>
		<li><b>Create:</b> Create a new, empty structure layer.</li>
		<li><b>Remove: </b>Remove a selected item from its layer.</li>
		<li><b>Visible:</b> Toggle whether the selected item is visible.</li>
		<li><b>Shadow: </b>Toggle whether the selected item should cast a shadow, 
		if structure shadows are enabled for this terrain.</li>
		<li><b>Show All:</b> When on, every single item will be shown for every 
		layer.&nbsp; When off, only a summary of the items is shown, e.g. &quot;Buildings: 
		172, Fences: 4&quot;.&nbsp; This makes the dialog much more responsive when 
		there are a lot of items in the scene.</li>
	</ul>
