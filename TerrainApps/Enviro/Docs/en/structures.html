<h2><i>Structure Layers</i></h2>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>Structures</i> in the VTP software means <b>buildings</b>, <b>linear</b> 
	structure such as walls and fences, and <b>instances</b> of external 3D model 
	files.&nbsp; They are contained in Structure Layers, which can be loaded and 
	saved to VTST files.&nbsp; You can have any number of structure layers on each 
	terrain.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Adding Structure Layers to your Terrain</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>To include structures from a VTST file, you can:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>edit the <a href="terrain_creation.html">properties for your terrain</a>.&nbsp; Under 
	the <b>Culture</b> tab, double-click <b>Structure Files</b> to choose from a 
	list of all the VTST files that are located in <b>BuildingData</b> folders on 
	your data path.</li>
		<li>Or, at runtime, you can load a Structure Layer from a VTST file, by 
		pressing <strong>Load Layer</strong> in the Layer Dialog.</li>
		<li>Or, at runtime, you can create a new, empty Structure Layer at runtime, by pressing 		<b>Create</b> in the Layer Dialog.</li>
	</ol>
