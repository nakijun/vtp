<h3>Dymaxion Textures</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The VTP libraries and applications support texture-mapping the whole earth
  using the <i>Dymaxion Projection</i>, which is an icosahedral projection of
  the earth developed by Buckminster Fuller in 1934.&nbsp; For more explanation
  of the projection, see <b>Icosahedral mapping</b> on the vterrain.org <a href="http://vterrain.org/Textures/spherical.html">Spherical Textures</a>
  page.</p>
  <p>10 square textures are used to cover the earth.&nbsp; However, most earth
  images are distributed as a single, large rectangular image using a straight
  geographic projection:</p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/earth-1.jpg" width="440" height="240"></p>
  <p>What is needed is a way to project this image into the 10 square texture
  tiles used for the Dymaxion Projection, which look like these:</p>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/earth-2.jpg" width="457" height="202"></p>
  <p>VTBuilder provides a menu command &quot;Project: Create Dymaxion
  Textures&quot; which will do this operation for you.&nbsp; It asks for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The filename of the original, which should be in BMP or PNG format</li>
    <li>The size of each output tile, in pixels.
      <ul>
        <li>You are given a choice of a power of 2, from 128 to 4096.&nbsp;
          Larger sizes give a crisper image on the earth, but use more texture
          memory.&nbsp; Here is a rough guide to how much texture memory will be
          required at run time:</li>
      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
        <tr>
          <td>Tile Size</td>
          <td>Texture Memory</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>256</td>
          <td>1.8 MB</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>512</td>
          <td>7.5 MB</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1024</td>
          <td>30 MB</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
        <li>Keep in mind the texture memory of the 3d card you will be using -
          30 MB of tiles will work on cards with 64 MB of memory, but cards with
          less should use a tile size of 512.</li>
        <li>Also remember that there is no need to exceed the resolution of your
          input file.&nbsp; As a rough guide, tile size should be <b>1/5 </b>of
          the source image width.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The prefix for the output files names.&nbsp; Can be any string, such as
      &quot;my_earth_512_&quot;&nbsp; It is recommended that you put the tile
      size (such as 512) in this file name.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The projection is then done and the files are written to the same directory
  as the source image.</p>
  <p>To use your image tiles in Enviro, copy them to the &quot;Data/WholeEarth&quot;
  folder, then choose it from the Enviro Startup dialog.</p>
