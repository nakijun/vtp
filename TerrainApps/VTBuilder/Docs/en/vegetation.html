<h3>Vegetation Layers</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>To learn how the VTP software represents vegetation, first read the web
  page <a href="http://vterrain.org/Doc/Veg/">VTP Implementation
  Vegetation</a>.&nbsp; The following assumes that you are familiar with the
  terminology.</p>
  <p>VTBuilder can import vegetation data from these formats:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ESRI Shape files (<b>.shp</b>)</li>
    <li>USGS LULC (Land Use / Land Cover, usual file extension is <b>.gir</b>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are several type of Vegetation Data.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Biotype</b> - polygonal areas which describe which biotype is found
      in that area.</li>
    <li><b>Density</b> - polygonal areas which contain information (0 to 1)
      about how dense the vegetation is.</li>
    <li><b>Explicit</b> - a set of actual plant instances.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Currently you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Import <b>Biotype</b> from Shapefiles.</li>
    <li>Import <b>Density</b> from LULC and Shapefiles.</li>
    <li>Read and write <b>Explicit</b> instances with VF files, which can also be read by VTP
      Enviro</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Before doing any operations with vegetation,<ol>
    <li>Make sure that you have a species file with the species you need.
    An example file is is <code>VTP/Enviro/Data/PlantData/species.xml</code></li>
    <li>Load your species file with the menu command &quot;Vegetation: Species List&quot;.&nbsp; </li>
    </ol>
  <p>If you have point data for each plant, use these steps to import explicit 
  plant instances:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use the menu command &quot;Layer: Import Data&quot; and indicate Vegetation.</li>
    <li>Indicate the file which contains the point locations of your instances.&nbsp; 
    Generally this is a SHP file.</li>
    <li>Save the resulting layer to a VF file, which can be used by Enviro.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>If you have an area covered by a single plant species, use these steps to 
  generate a vegetation distribution:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use the <a href="export_area.html">Area Tool</a> to indicate the area in which to distribute the
      vegetation</li>
    <li>Give the menu command &quot;Area Tool - Generate  Vegetation&quot;&nbsp; A dialog will ask for :
      <ul>
        <li>Grid Spacing of Sampling, in meters.&nbsp; The distribution will
          occur on a regular grid.&nbsp; At each point, it will test to see what
          kind of plant belongs at that location, given all known inputs.&nbsp;
          Then, if a plant is generated, a small random offset is applied to
          avoid the &quot;regular&quot; look of an evenly distribution.</li>
        <li>Artificial Scarcity.&nbsp; Most interactive simulation can't handle
          the full density of real-world vegetation.&nbsp; You can set this to a
          value less than 1 to produce an artificially scarce
          distribution.&nbsp; For example, 0.001 will produce 1/1000 of the
          normal density of vegetation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The resulting VF file can be used by Enviro.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>If you instead have polygon data which described the general area covered 
  by a number of plants, use these steps to generate a vegetation distribution:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Load your Bioregion (list of Biotypes) with the menu command 
    &quot;Vegetation: BioRegions&quot;.<br>
    An example file is in <code>Data/PlantData/bioregion.txt<br>
    </code>The plant densities are in plants per square meter.</li>
    <li>Import at least one vegetation layer with <b>Biotype</b>.&nbsp; Biotype is by 
    0-based index, so a integer field with values of 0, 1, 2, 3 etc. indicates 
    which biotype.</li>
    <li>If you also (<i>optionally</i>) have polygon data with additional information about plant density, import that layer as <b>Density</b>.&nbsp; 
    This can be the same GIS file that contains the Biotype, or a separate file 
    such as a LULC file.&nbsp; If you don't have a data file, the default of 
    &quot;Normal Density&quot; will be assumed.</li>
    <li>Use the <a href="export_area.html">Area Tool</a> to indicate the area in which to distribute the
      vegetation</li>
    <li>Give the menu command &quot;Area Tool - Generate  Vegetation&quot;&nbsp; A dialog will ask for :
      <ul>
        <li>Grid Spacing of Sampling, in meters.&nbsp; The distribution will 
        occur on a regular grid.&nbsp; At each point, it will test to see what 
        kind of plant belongs at that location, given all known inputs.&nbsp; 
        Then, if a plant is generated, a small random offset is applied to avoid 
        the &quot;regular&quot; look of an gridded distribution.</li>
        <li>Artificial Scarcity.&nbsp; Most interactive simulation can't handle
          the full density of real-world vegetation.&nbsp; You can set this to a
          value less than 1 to produce an artificially scarce
          distribution.&nbsp; For example, 0.001 will produce 1/1000 of the
          normal density of vegetation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A VF file will be produced.&nbsp; You can load this file back into 
    VTBuilder to check for correct distribution, or you can load it into Enviro 
    for 3D visualization.</li>
  </ol>
