<h3>Importing Data into VTBuilder</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>There are two ways to import data files: with the &quot;Layer: Import&quot; command, or 
by using drag-and-drop to drag files into the VTBuilder window.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Layer: Import</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>With the Layer: Import command, you will be asked for the kind of data to 
expect: Elevation, Imagery, and so forth.&nbsp; This is important because many 
file formats can be interpreted in more than one way.&nbsp; For example, a 
Shapefile (.shp) can be used to represent Water, Road, or Building features.&nbsp; 
Since Shapefiles lack any kind of standards for attributes, a computer can't 
guess what sort of data it really is, unless it knows what to expect.&nbsp; For 
another example, TIF files can be interpreted as either Imagery or Elevation, so 
telling VTBuilder makes it clear how to handle your TIF file.</p>
<p>Depending on the layer type, VTBuilder may give you additional dialogs to 
clarify how to import the data.&nbsp; See the documentation for each layer type 
(e.g. <a href="buildings.html">Structure Layers</a>) for an explanation of the 
issues involved in importing data of that type.&nbsp; If the data lacks a
<a href="projdlg.html">CRS</a>, then you may be shown the <a href="projdlg.html">
Projection Dialog</a> to specify it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Drag-and-Drop</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The fastest and easiest way to import files is to drag-and-drop them from 
your operating system file manager.&nbsp; Multiple files can be imported at once 
by dragging over a group of icons.&nbsp; This is really useful when you have a 
whole directory full of small files which need to be imported and merged.</p>
<p>When you drop files, VTBuilder won't ask you the layer type for each file, 
but instead will do its best to guess.&nbsp; Un-guessable GIS files like .shp 
will be imported as Raw layers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Compressed File Support (.gz, .tar.gz, and .zip)</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you drag-and-drop a compressed (archive) file, VTBuilder will quietly 
  unarchive it to a temporary folder, and look in that folder for something to 
  import.&nbsp; If the archive contains a single file, it will act as if you 
  dropped in that file by itself.&nbsp; If the archive contains multiple files, 
  it will look for distinctive patterns like &quot;catd.ddf&quot; and &quot;.dem&quot; to try figure 
  out what to import.</p>
  <p>The feature is very convenient for the user, especially for awkward formats 
  like SDTS.</p>
  <p>If you encounter a situation where a file is not importing as expected, 
  please let us know.</p>
