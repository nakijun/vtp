<h2>Area Tool</h2>
This tool lets you indicate a rectangular area of interest.&nbsp; It's useful for 
indicating <i>where</i> you want to operate on other layers, such as elevation, 
imagery, and vegetation.
<h3>Area Tool Menu:</h3>
<ul class="tuck">
	<li>Clear<ul>
		<li>Sets the area to no area (0,0,0,0)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Set to Full Extents<ul>
		<li>Resizes the area tool to surround all of the currently loaded layers.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Set to Layer Extents<ul>
		<li>Resizes the area tool to surround the currently selected layer.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Numeric Values
	<ul>
		<li>Allows you to examine and manually enter the range of the area tool.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Match Area and Tiling to Layer
	<ul>
		<li>This is useful when you will be tiling your terrain, and you want to 
		sample your data at its exact, full resolution.&nbsp; See <b>Match Area 
		and Tiling to Layer Dialog </b>below.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Sample Elevation
	<ul>
		<li>Displays the <b>Sample Elevation</b> dialog (see below)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Ssample Imagery<ul>
		<li>Displays the <b>Sample Imagery</b> dialog (see below)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Generate Vegetation
	<ul>
		<li>See <a href="vegetation.html">Vegetation</a> for an description of how 
		to use this command.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Compute Vegetation Density<ul>
		<li>Reports the number of plants inside the area tool, both as number by 
		species, and as density in instances per square meter.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Request Layer from WFS</li>
	<li>Request Layer from WMS<ul>
		<li>These are experimental commands.&nbsp; If you know how to use a WFS 
		or WMS, give them a try!</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Sample Elevation to Tileset<ul>
		<li>Like the <b>Sample Elevation</b> command, this will sample all elevation 
		data inside the area, but the output is a tileset.&nbsp; It is a sophisticated 
		algorithm which samples one tile at a time so the entire area does not have 
		to fit into RAM while processing.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Sample Imagery to Tileset<ul>
		<li>Like the <b>Sample Imagery </b>command, this will sample all imagery 
		data inside the area, but the output is a tileset.&nbsp; It is a sophisticated 
		algorithm which samples one tile at a time so the entire area does not have 
		to fit into RAM while processing.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Toolbar:</h3>
<ul class="tuck">
	<li>The Area Tool (<img alt="area tool" src="../images/tb_area.png" />) 
	can be used to set the desired area directly with the mouse.&nbsp; Click on 
	any edge of the area tool to move that edge, or click inside to move the whole 
	area without resizing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sample Elevation Dialog</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>You can choose where the output will go: to a new layer (in memory), or to a 
	file.</p>
	<p>This dialog displays:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The size of the <b>Save Area</b>, in either meters or degrees</li>
		<li>An estimated <b>Sample factor</b>, which is a guess based on looking 
		at the X spacing of the first elevation layer.</li>
		<li>The projected <b>Size at that density</b>, which shows you the size 
		of a grid that would result from sampling the area at the indicated sample 
		factor.&nbsp; Assuming that your input layers are of the same density (spacing), 
		this indicates the approximate grid size of the indicated area.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Output to a new layer or to a file:</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>You can change the sample factor to see the projected size change.&nbsp; 
		Once you have a good idea of what output size you want, specify it in the &quot;<b>X 
		size</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>Y size</b>&quot; fields.</p>
		<p>Note that there is a helpful &quot;<b>Powers of 2 + 1</b>&quot; constraint 
		you can use to limit the output to sizes which are supported by Terrain 
		LOD, which is highly desirable at visualization runtime.</p>
		<p>For effective visualization it is recommended that you pick a output 
		size that is at least as large as your input data, but within the limits 
		of your computer's RAM.</p>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3>Sample Elevation to Tileset</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>There is no limit on the size of the data.&nbsp; Give the output 
		a filename, and set the number of rows and columns of the tile grid along 
		with the tile size (LOD0 Size) which gives the highest resolution of each 
		tile.&nbsp; The <b>Information</b> display helps you see whether your tiling 
		is a good approximation of the input data your are resampling.&nbsp; For 
		smoother visualization, is it good to keep the tile grid size large and 
		the LOD0 Size small (512 or less) so that there are shorter pauses as each 
		tile is paged.&nbsp; Alternately, if smoothness isn't a concern, you can 
		decrease the tile grid size, and increase the LOD0 Size, which will result 
		in a drastically smaller number of files on your disk.</p>
	<p>Optionally, while you are creating an elevation tileset, you can also 
		create a corresponding image tileset which is derived from the elevation.&nbsp; 
		This is very useful when you have a large amount of elevation, but no source 
		imagery.&nbsp; The <strong><a href="renderdlg.html">Rendering Options</a></strong> 
		dialog sets how the elevation is rendered.</p>
	<p>See <a href="../Enviro/tilesets.html">Enviro: Tilesets</a> for a description 
		of how tilesets are handled at runtime.&nbsp; If you are using a tileset 
		for your elevation, you must have a tileset of the same grid size for the 
		imagery.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Sample Imagery Dialog</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>You can choose where the output will go: To a new layer (in memory), or to a 
	file.</p>
	<p>This dialog displays:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The size of the <b>Save Area</b>, in either meters or degrees</li>
		<li>An estimated <b>Sample factor</b>, which is a guess based on looking 
		at the X spacing of the first imagery layer.</li>
		<li>The projected <b>Size at that density</b>, which shows you the size 
		of a grid that would result from sampling the area at the indicated sample 
		factor.&nbsp; Assuming that your input layers are of the same density (spacing), 
		this indicates the approximate grid size of the indicated area.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Output to a new layer or to a file:</h4>
	<blockquote>
		<p>You can change the sample factor to see the projected size change.&nbsp; 
		Once you have a good idea of what output size you want, specify it in the &quot;<b>X 
		size</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>Y size</b>&quot; fields.</p>
		<p>Note that there is a helpful &quot;<b>Powers of 2</b>&quot; constraint 
		you can use to limit the output to sizes which are supported by the visualization 
		runtime.</p>
		<p>For effective visualization it is recommended that you pick a output 
		size that is at least as large as your input data, but within the limits 
		of your computer's RAM.</p>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3>Sample Imagery to Tileset</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>There is no limit on the size of the data.&nbsp; Give the output 
		a filename (in a <em>GeoSpecific</em> folder on your data path), and set the number of rows and columns of the tile grid along 
		with the tile size (LOD0 Size) which gives the highest resolution of each 
		tile.&nbsp; The <b>Information</b> display helps you see whether your tiling 
		is a good approximation of the input data your are resampling.&nbsp; For 
		smoother visualization, is it good to keep the tile grid size large and 
		the LOD0 Size small (512 or less) so that there are shorter pauses as each 
		tile is paged.&nbsp; Alternately, if smoothness isn't a concern, you can 
		decrease the tile grid size, and increase the LOD0 Size, which will result 
		in a drastically smaller number of files on your disk.</p>
	<p>See <a href="../Enviro/tilesets.html">Enviro: Tilesets</a> for a description 
		of how tilesets are handled at runtime.&nbsp; If you are using a tileset 
		for your imagery, you must have a tileset of the same number of rows and 
	columns for the 
		elevation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Match Area<b> and Tiling to Layer</b> Dialog</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>This is useful when you will be tiling your terrain, and you want to sample 
	your data at its exact, full resolution.&nbsp; For example, if you have some 
	elevation data with 10m spacing or aerial photos with 1m spacing, you will probably 
	want your tile resolution to match this exactly, so that you are seeing your 
	full original data without any sampling artifacts.</p>
	<p>Set the area you are interested in, with the Area Tool, then give this command.&nbsp; 
	You should see the dialog <b>Match Area and Tiling to Layer.</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><b><i>Previous:</i> </b>This is your original area of interest, which 
		we will try to match.</li>
		<li><b><i>Current: </i></b>This is the current tiled area, as close as possible 
		to the original area.</li>
		<li><b><i>Match Layer: </i></b>This is the layer you want to match.&nbsp; 
		For example, if you have one layers at 2m and some others at 4m, you might 
		want to tell the dialog to match the 2m layer.</li>
		<li><b><i>Layer Resolution: </i></b>This shows you the resolution (X and 
		Y spacing) of the selected layer.</li>
		<li><i><b>Allow Area to Grow/Shrink:</b>&nbsp; </i>In case your desired 
		area can't be matched exactly with tiling, the area will need to grow or 
		shrink.&nbsp; You can indicate which is allowable.&nbsp; For example, if 
		you are sampling elevation, you will probably not want to grow the area 
		outside the bounds of your original area, because then you would be sampling 
		from an area with no elevation, which is undesirable.</li>
		<li><b><i>Tile LOD0 Size: </i></b>This is value you set.&nbsp; Tiles have 
		a number of levels of detail (LOD), which are numbered starting from 0.&nbsp; 
		Hence, the LOD0 size is the highest resolution of each tile, which is value 
		we want to match to the input data.&nbsp; For efficient paging at runtime, 
		you should try to keep this value small (512 for elevation, 1024 for imagery).&nbsp; 
		You can make it smaller, for even smoother paging at the expense of more 
		tile files.</li>
		<li><b><i>Tiling: </i></b>This is the tiling that results from matching 
		your desired resolution and area.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The tiling (area and number of tiles) is also shown visually in the main 
	view.</p>
