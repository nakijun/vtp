<h2>Area Tool</h2>
This tool lets you indicate a rectangular area of
interest.&nbsp; It's useful for indicating <i>where</i> you want to operate on 
other layers, such as elevation, imagery, and vegetation.

</ul>

<h3>Toolbar:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Area Tool (<img border="0" src="images/tb_area.png" align="bottom" width="39" height="37">) 
  can be used to set the desired area directly with the mouse.&nbsp; Click on 
  any edge of the area tool to move that edge, or click inside to move the whole 
  area without resizing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Merge and Resample Elevation Dialog</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>You can choose where the output will go: To a new layer (in memory), To a 
  file, or To a tileset (folder of tiles).</p>
  <p>This dialog displays:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The size of the <b>Save Area</b>, in either meters or degrees</li>
    <li>An estimated <b>Sample factor</b>, which is a guess based on looking at
      the X spacing of the first elevation layer.</li>
    <li>The projected <b>Size at that density</b>, which shows you the size of a grid
      that would result from sampling the area at the indicated sample
      factor.&nbsp; Assuming that your input layers are of the same density
      (spacing), this indicates the approximate grid size of the indicated area.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Output to a new layer or to a file:</h4>
  <blockquote>
  <p>You can change the sample factor to see the projected size change.&nbsp;
  Once you have a good idea of what output size you want, specify it in the
  &quot;<b>X size</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>Y size</b>&quot; fields.</p>
  <p>Note that there is a helpful &quot;<b>Powers of 2 + 1</b>&quot; constraint
  you can use to limit the output to sizes which are supported by Terrain LOD,
  which is highly desirable at visualization runtime.</p>
  <p>For effective visualization it is recommended that you pick a output size
  that is at least as large as your input data, but within the limits of your
  computer's RAM.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h4>Output to a folder of tiles (Tileset):</h4>
  <blockquote>
  <p>This option has no limit on the size of the data.&nbsp; Press <i>Tile 
  Options</i> for the <b>Tiling Options</b> dialog.&nbsp; Give the output a 
  filename, and set the number of rows and columns of the tile grid along with 
  the tile size (LOD0 Size) which gives the highest resolution of each tile.&nbsp; 
  The <b>Information</b> display helps you see whether your tiling is a good 
  approximation of the input data your are resampling.&nbsp; For smoother 
  visualization, is it good to keep the tile grid size large and the LOD0 Size 
  small (512 or less) so that there are shorter pauses as each tile is paged.&nbsp; 
  Alternately, if smoothness isn't a concern, you can decrease the tile grid 
  size, and increase the LOD0 Size, which will result in a drastically smaller 
  number of files on your disk.</p>
  <p>See <a href="../Enviro/tilesets.html">Enviro: Tilesets</a> for a 
  description of how tilesets are handled at runtime.&nbsp; If you are using a 
  tileset for your elevation, you must have a tileset of the same grid size for 
  the imagery.</p>

<h3>Merge and Resample Imagery Dialog</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>You can choose where the output will go: To a new layer (in memory), To a

  <p>This dialog displays:</p>

      the X spacing of the first imagery layer.</li>
    <li>The projected <b>Size at that density</b>, which shows you the size of a grid

<h3>Match Area<b> and Tiling to Layer</b> Dialog</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is useful when you will be tiling your terrain, and you want to sample 
  your data at its exact, full resolution.&nbsp; For example, if you have some 
  elevation data with 10m spacing or aerial photos with 1m spacing, you will 
  probably want your tile resolution to match this exactly, so that you are 
  seeing your full original data without any sampling artifacts.</p>
  <p>Set the area you are interested in, with the Area Tool, then give this 
  command.&nbsp; You should see the dialog <b>Match Area and Tiling to Layer.</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><b><i>Previous:</i> </b>This is your original area of interest, which we 
    will try to match.</li>
    <li><b><i>Current: </i></b>This is the current tiled area, as close as 
    possible to the original area.</li>
    <li><b><i>Match Layer: </i></b>This is the layer you want to match.&nbsp; 
    For example, if you have one layers at 2m and some others at 4m, you might 
    want to tell the dialog to match the 2m layer.</li>
    <li><b><i>Layer Resolution: </i></b>This shows you the resolution (X and Y 
    spacing) of the selected layer.</li>
    <li><i><b>Allow Area to Grow/Shrink:</b>&nbsp; </i>In case your desired area 
    can't be matched exactly with tiling, the area will need to grow or shrink.&nbsp; 
    You can indicate which is allowable.&nbsp; For example, if you are sampling 
    elevation, you will probably not want to grow the area outside the bounds of 
    your original area, because then you would be sampling from an area with no 
    elevation, which is undesirable.</li>
    <li><b><i>Tile LOD0 Size: </i></b>This is value you set.&nbsp; Tiles have a 
    number of levels of detail (LOD), which are numbered starting from 0.&nbsp; 
    Hence, the LOD0 size is the highest resolution of each tile, which is value 
    we want to match to the input data.&nbsp; For efficient paging at runtime, 
    you should try to keep this value small (512 for elevation, 1024 for 
    imagery).&nbsp; You can make it smaller, for even smoother paging at the 
    expense of more tile files.</li>
    <li><b><i>Tiling: </i></b>This is the tiling that results from matching your 
    desired resolution and area.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The tiling (area and number of tiles) is also shown visually in the main 
  view.</p>
