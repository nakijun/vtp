<h3>Water Layers</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>VTBuilder can import water (shoreline/river vectors) data from these formats:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>USGS DLG Hydrography</li>
    <li>US Census TIGER</li>
    <li>ESRI Shape files and other GIS vector formats</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Currently you can only display water data.&nbsp; This can be very useful as 
  an aid in aligning other data layers.&nbsp; However, since there is no 
  standard file format yet for streams and rivers, they can't be saved.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Water as an Elevation Layer</h3>
<p class="style1">The VTP 3D runtime environment (Enviro) can load an elevation 
TIN as a water surface.&nbsp; This is a very powerful way to represent water, as 
a surface which typically intersects the ground surface.&nbsp; Where is it 
higher than the ground, water is visible.&nbsp; This is very similar to how 
water is modeled as &quot;water table&quot; in hydrology.</p>
<p class="style1">To work with this kind of water in VTBuilder, it is treated 
just like an elevation TIN, so you can treat it as an <a href="elevation.html">
Elevation Layer</a>.&nbsp; Save your TIN to the standard format (.itf) and 
location (Data/Elevation).&nbsp; In Enviro, you can specify it as water using
<strong>Terrain Parameters: Ephemeris: Water surface</strong>.</p>
