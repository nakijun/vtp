<h3>Projections and Coordinate Systems</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>It&#39;s recommended to read the VTP website regarding
	<a href="http://vterrain.org/Projections/">Coordinate Systems and Map Projections</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Technically speaking, what VTBuilder refers to as a &quot;projection&quot; is actually 
	a &quot;coordinate reference system&quot;, or CRS for short.&nbsp; However, since a great 
	may CRS are projected, it is a common colloquial usage to refer to a CRS as 
	a projection.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Projection Dialog</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>This dialog is displayed on the menu items View: Set or Convert Projection, 
	and also when VTBuilder needs to ask you for a CRS, such as when importing a 
	file which lacks a CRS.</p>
	<p>There are several fields which define a CRS, which are displayed in the dialog:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Projection</b><ul>
			<li>This can be either Geographic (longitude-latitude, not projected) 
			or any of several styles of projection, such as Transverse Mercator 
			or Lambert Conformal Conic.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b>Datum</b><ul>
			<li>You can choose from a short list of commonly-used Datums, or click 
			&quot;Show All Datums&quot; to select from a long list of more unusual Datums.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b>Horizontal Units</b><ul>
			<li>This is always Degrees for a Geographic CRS.&nbsp; For most projections, 
			it can be Meters, Feet, or US Survey Feet.&nbsp; For the Dymaxion Projection, 
			this value is always Unit Edges (1.0 = length of a projected face edge)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b>Zone</b><ul>
			<li>Certain projections, such as UTM, can be specified quickly with 
			a Zone number.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b>Parameters</b><ul>
			<li>If your projection is unusual (not common, like UTM), then you may 
			have to manually enter the parameters.&nbsp; To edit them, select any 
			value then right-click it to supply a new value.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There are also some commands to make specifying projections easier:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Set State Plane Projection</b><ul>
			<li>If you know that your CRS is a U.S. State Plane CS, then you can 
			use this command to specify it, and the parameters will be automatically 
			supplied.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b>Load / Save to File</b><ul>
			<li>It is often convenient to define a projection once, then recall 
			it easily later.&nbsp; These commands will save and load the current 
			projection to a standard projection file (.prj) which contains a Well-Known-Text 
			representation of the CRS.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
