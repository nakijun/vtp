<h2 class="tcenter">The VTP Software</h2>
<p class="tcenter"><em>A Short Introduction</em></p>

<h4>Very Briefly</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>The purpose of the VTP software is to allow you to rapidly construct an interactive 
	3D visualization of any part of the real world.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>In Detail</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>The general process of building a visualization using the VTP tools is to
	<b>import</b> data files into <a href="VTBuilder/Docs/index.html">VTBuilder</a>, 
	manipulate them in a content-specific manner, then <b>export</b> them into a 
	series of runtime files.&nbsp; The runtime files are placed into the appropriate 
	Data directory, then <a href="Enviro/Docs/index.html">Enviro</a> is used for 
	a realtime visualization of the data.</p>
	<p>See the VTBuilder and Enviro documentation for the step-by-step process of 
	reading your data in, and visualizing it.&nbsp; This includes elevation, roads, 
	trees, buildings and fences.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Cropping and Sampling Images</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>If you have imagery that you wish to drape, that does not matches your elevation 
	in projection and extents, then you will need to crop and/or re-project it to 
	match.&nbsp; The VTP software does not have these features.&nbsp; Here are some 
	possible approaches you can use:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If you happen to have it, many high-end software packages such as
		<a href="http://www.gis.leica-geosystems.com/Products/product_details.asp?productid=1">
		ERDAS Imagine</a> can do these steps.</li>
		<li>The inexpensive software <a href="http://www.globalmapper.com/">Global 
		Mapper</a> is capable of loading any number of images, displaying them with 
		any given projection, and extracting a rectangular area (cropping).</li>
		<li>If you are technically savvy, the cross-platform open-source package
		<a href="http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/">GDAL</a> provides a command-line 
		tool called &#39;gdal_translate&#39; which can be configured to re-project 
		and extract rectangular areas.&nbsp; The <code>-projwin</code> option is 
		useful for this purpose.</li>
		<li>Finally, if you only need to extract a rectangular area, it may be possible 
		to use a conventional bitmap application like PhotoShop to crop to the area 
		of interest.&nbsp; This requires some manual arithmetic to turn coordinates 
		into pixel values.</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>
<h4>Custom 3D Geometry</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>If you want to import your own, custom 3D models, here are some details about 
	how the software supports them.</p>
	<p>One of the things which <a href="Enviro/Docs/index.html">Enviro</a> can do 
	is to place one or more instances of a 3D object on a terrain surface. In order 
	to do this, it requires two types of files: one to specify the location of the 
	object, and the other to specify the object surface geometry. The first file 
	is a VT Structure File (VTST), and is typically created in
	<a href="VTBuilder/Docs/index.html">VTBuilder</a> based on GIS data representing 
	object center points or footprints in a geographic coordinate system. (The &quot;Building 
	Extractor&quot; and &quot;Content Manager&quot; applications can also generate 
	these.) The object geometry file can be in any format recognized by the underlying
	<a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/">OpenSceneGraph</a> system and is typically 
	generated in a 3D surface modeler or CAD system. Typical formats include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>.3DS (the export format from Discrete&#39;s Studio Max application, 
		also exported by AutoCAD) </li>
		<li>.LWO (Lightwave)</li>
		<li>.FLT (OpenFlight format - with import/export plugin available for Alias|Wavefront&#39;s 
		Maya) </li>
		<li>.OSG (OpenSceneGraph format). </li>
	</ul>
	<p>There is now some support for VRML 1.0 and other formats, check the
	<a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/">OpenSceneGraph</a> website for a full 
	current list, and limitations.&nbsp; The application
	<a href="CManager/Docs/index.html">CManager</a> can be used to preview your 
	models to see how they will appear in <a href="Enviro/Docs/index.html">Enviro</a>.</p>
	<p>In order to understand the relationship between the two files (VTST and 3D 
	model) it is helpful to view the structure file contents. The VT structure file 
	is itself a type of XML file, and can be viewed in a text editor. It can contain 
	references (by name) to instances of 3D models. (It is the same format used 
	for parametric building property descriptions used by Enviro in generating buildings 
	procedurally at load time, but that is not relevant here.) The two types of 
	files are placed in separate locations for runtime use:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>VTST files should go in the BuildingData folder, which is underneath 
		the Data folder </li>
		<li>3D object files can be located anywhere on your machine </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Once you have the VTST files in place, they should show up Enviro settings 
	dialog in the &quot;Buildings&quot; popup menu. (You can only have one VTST 
	file per terrain.)</p>
